After an experience in the beauty sector, I choosed to reorient myself in th web/software development.
I recently finished my journey at [Becode](https://becode.org/), a code academy in LiÃ¨ge.
Now, it's time to practice everything that I've learned with an internship!
I will be in the computer science department of Solidaris LiÃ¨ge for the next 3 months!
